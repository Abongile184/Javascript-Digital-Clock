# Javascript-Digital-Clock
This ia a Javascript Digital Alarm Clock that i made as a side project to re inforce my understanding of Object Oriented programming
- its consists of classes abd methods 
- it also makes use of Document Object Model techniques
- working with sound file(s)
- date objects
The original code was just a digital clock but i turned it into an alarm clcok

issues:
dynamically creating html elements impacted my user interface
this use of OOP made the program slower in terms of performance 
code needs to be optimized
