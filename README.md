# Javascript-Digital-Clock: https://abongile184.github.io/Javascript-Digital-Clock/
This is a Javascript Digital Alarm Clock that i made as a side project to re inforce my understanding of Object Oriented programming
- its consists of classes abd methods 
- it also makes use of Document Object Model techniques
- working with sound file(s)
- date objects
The original code was just a digital clock but i turned it into an alarm clock
i also wanted to add another feature where once the alarm rings a model with a quote pops up and closes once user presses anywhere on the app
and then alarm ringtone stops also but the more features i add the longer my methods

issues:
dynamically creating html elements impacted my user interface
this use of OOP made the program slower in terms of performance 
code needs to be optimized
